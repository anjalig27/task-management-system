# Task Management System

This is a task management project built using PostgreSQL, Express.js, Angular, Node.js, and Material-UI. It provides a web-based interface for users to create and manage their tasks.

## Features
- Create, get, and delete tasks.

## Technologies Used
1. **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database used for storing and managing task and user data.
2. **Angular**: A robust front-end framework used for building dynamic and scalable web applications.
3. **Material-UI**: A popular UI component library for Angular, providing a modern and responsive design.
4. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side scripting and executing backend logic.
5. **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle server-side logic, routing, and API development.
6. **Sequelize**: A promise-based Node.js ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) used for interacting with the PostgreSQL database, enabling easy database operations and model management.
